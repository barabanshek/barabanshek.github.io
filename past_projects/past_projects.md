In the past, I was involved in some decent amount of projects both in the industry and academia. Here, I am listing the most interesting of them.


## Industry

##### <ins>Honeycomb: CPU-free Cloud Datastore System</ins>

Fork of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/farm/" title="MSRC">Microsoft FaRM</a> project, where we had been working on designing a CPU-free datastore architecture (implemented entirely in hardware, on an FPGA) for the applications in distributed graph databases and low-latency key-value stores.

Implementation of a fast micro-second scale reliable networking stack on an FPGA.

##### <ins>Android ART: Java Runtime and Compiler</ins>

R&D project around optimization of the Android ART (Android Runtime) for performance and memory footprint. The project scope included compiler (both AOT and JIT) and runtime optimizations such as application memory snapshotting, vectorization, fast class booting, etc.

Implementation of loop transformations, optimization of the runtime hash table for Java strings, optimization of Java class loading with static analysis of class references, and all sorts of bug fix and production support.

## Academia

##### <ins>Low-Latency Realtime PID Controller for Lasers</ins>

Design and implementation of a low-latency realtime PID controller for lasers for the research of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/farm/" title="MSRC">Laboratory for Quantum Gases</a> at EPFL.

Mixed signal PCB design with high-speed high-precision ADCs/DACs, FPGA programming, fabrication, and testing.

##### <ins>A System For Realtime Diagnosis of Rotating Machines</ins>

The main purpose of this project is making a system capable of realtime diagnostics of rotating machines by using a single sensor: an optical encoder. The system consists of a realtime FPGA-based unit for recording and pre-processing data from the sensor, and the machine-learning part running offline for data analysis.

Creating the concept of the project, implementation of the first FPGA-based prototype.

## Independent Projects

##### <ins>3D Printer with Non-Cartesian (Parallel) Kinematics</ins>

Development of a robot with the new non-cartesian kinematics for 3D printing. The main novelty of this work is the support-less kinematic scheme where stability of the structure is reached through coordinated operation of actuators. This project started as independent hobby work with my friend and collaborator, and turned into our join undergraduate thesis.

Development of the robot control system, and its implementation in the on-board firmware.
