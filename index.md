**I'm Nikita.**

<font size="4"> I'm a third-year PhD student @ <a href="http://cornell.edu/" title="Cornell">Cornell Univesity</a>. Here, I'm a part of the <a href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/" title="Cornell">Computer System Laboratory</a>, where we do exciting research on new software and hardware systems for the cloud under the guidance of <a href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/" title="Cornell">Professor Zhiru Zhang</a> and <a href="https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~delimitrou/" title="Cornell">Professor Christina Delimitrou</a>. </font>

These days, I'm generally interested in **cloud computing**, **low latency networking/distributed systems**, and **computer architecture**. My research focuses on exploring various hardware innovations to reduce (and even eliminate) *the datacenter tax* and make cloud computing more efficient, fast, end environmental friendly.

> I stepped onto my PhD journey with a diverse engineering background after earning an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://bmstu.ru/" title="BMSTU">BMSTU</a>, an MS degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://epfl.ch/" title="EPFL">EPFL</a>, and working as a software developer at a Samsung R&D Institute for about two years. 
<br/><br/>I was an intern and visiting student researcher at Microsoft Research in 2017 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/" title="MSRIndia">India</a>), 2018 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/" title="MSRC">Cambridge, UK</a>), and 2021 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/" title="MSRR">Redmond, USA</a>) working with great people and on exciting technologies such as _5G_, _low-latency database systems_, and _real-time machine learning_.

In my free time, I enjoy all sorts of **intense** outdoor activity, in particular plying tennis, hiking, skiing, surfing. I also like traveling and exploring the world. So far, I have lived in 5 different countries and visited 28 other countries as a tourist.


### As a systems researcher (and engineer), I enjoy building things!

And this is very true! Nothing (even accepted papers) motivates me as much as a really running system.
{:.note}

Building systems as a hardware-focused researcher is challenging in academia. It takes time and requires additional efforts to attract industrial collaborators to support the projects. But this is another part of our work that I really enjoy! Our research is supported by <a href="https://www.intel.com/" title="Intel">Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/" title="Xilinx">Xilinx</a>, and I'm very grateful for all their help.
