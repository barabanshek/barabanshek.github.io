**I'm Nikita.**

<font size="4"> I'm a third-year PhD student @ <a href="http://cornell.edu/" title="Cornell">Cornell Univesity</a>. Here, I'm a part of the Computer System Laboratory where we do exciting research on new software and hardware systems for the cloud. </font>

These days, I am generally interested in **cloud computing**, **low latency networking/distributed systems**, and **computer architecture**. My research focuses on exploring various hardware innovations to reduce (and even eliminate) *the datacenter tax* and make cloud computing more efficient, fast, end environmental friendly.

> I stepped onto my PhD journey with a diverse engineering background after earning an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="http://bmstu.ru/" title="BMSTU">BMSTU</a>, an MS degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://epfl.ch/" title="EPFL">EPFL</a>, and working as a software developer at a Samsung R&D Institute for about two years. 
<br/><br/>I was an intern and visiting student researcher at Microsoft Research in 2017 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/" title="MSRIndia">India</a>), 2018 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/" title="MSRC">Cambridge, UK</a>), and 2021 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/" title="MSRR">Redmond, USA</a>) working with great people and on exciting technologies such as 5G, low-latency database systems, and real-time machine learning.


Thanks to amazing MSR, I had been living in four different countries on three continents. This sums up to the total of 41 countries that I have visited so far, and five countries where I have lived for more than 3 months. So yes, **I love traveling**. In fact, this was one of the reasons I decided to do grad school (*which in the pre-COVID world used to come with a lot of traveling around the world*).


### As a systems researcher (and engineer), I enjoy building things!

And that's true! I have been always building stuff. During the undergrad, internships, the Master's jorney, and now. Nothing (even accepted papers) motivates me as much as a really running system.
{:.note}

Building systems as a hardware-focused researcher is challenging in academia. It takes time and requires additional efforts to attract industrial collaborators to support the projects. But this is anoter part of our work that I really enjoy! Our research is supported by <a href="https://www.intel.com/" title="Intel">Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/" title="Xilinx">Xilinx</a>, and I am very gratefull for all their help.
